# This repository is a monorepo.

Like [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages), and other multi-package node projects, this repository follows a monorepo structure.

See the [Babel design doc](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/75720a32436cb86eb027c640259c900c292b7a9e/doc/design/monorepo.md) for some nice rationale.

[Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) is used to manage this multi-package project.
