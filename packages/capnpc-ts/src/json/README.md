# JSON-based Schema Compiler

This directory contains a quick-and-dirty implementation of a schema compiler directly from a JSON representation of a CodeGeneratorRequest. It was used to help bootstrap the implementation of the rest of the schema compiler.

This is merely archived here for historical purposes given that there is a bootstrapped implementation of the schema compiler now. It may be deleted from the repository entirely at some point.
